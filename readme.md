# License Plate Recognition System

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a License Plate Recognition system using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system can detect a license plate in an image and recognize the characters using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model.

By working on this project, you will gain an understanding of how to implement a complete plate detection and recognition system from scratch.

## Features

- Detects license plates from images.
- Recognizes and classifies characters from license plates using OCR.
- Utilizes a Random Forest classifier trained on a custom dataset.
- Implements image processing techniques using OpenCV.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow 2.17.0
- OpenCV 	4.10.0.84	
- NumPy 1.26.4
- Pandas 2.2.3
- Matplotlib 3.9.2
- Scikit-learn 1.5.2

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
